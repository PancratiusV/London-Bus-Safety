# London Bus Performance
# Introduction
This is a dataset contains the details of all bus related injuries since 2014 in London. The dataset includes the date of the incident, route, bus operator, gender, injury outcome, and more. This data is important for creating action plans and strategies for bus safety, as well as reporting trends and patterns.

The data is sourced from [Transport For London](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/bus-safety-data)

# Data Cleaning and Analysis
All the cleaning and analysis is done on a jupyter notebook: [London Bus Safety Performance](/London%20Bus%20Safety%20Performance.ipynb).

The questions I answered are:
1. What year have the most injuries?
2. Which months have the most injuries?
3. Does the borough have an effect on the frequency of collision injuries?
4. Which bus operator have the most "Serious" or "Fatal" injuries?



# Further Analysis
There is so much to uncover in this dataset. I will continue to add questions to answer and analysis in the future, as well as data visualization on Tableu.
