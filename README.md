# London Bus Performance
# Introduction
This is a dataset that contains the details of all bus related injuries in London since 2014. The dataset includes the date of the incident, route, bus operator, gender, injury outcome, and more. This data is important for creating action plans and strategies for bus safety, as well as reporting trends and patterns.

The data is sourced from [Transport For London](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/bus-safety-data)

# Data Cleaning and Analysis
All the cleaning and analysis is done on a jupyter notebook: [London Bus Safety Performance](/London%20Bus%20Safety%20Performance.ipynb).
